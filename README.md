# Field Survey of the Blue Mountains World Heritage Area, NSW (FAIMS3)

## About this notebook:
This module was created for the field survey of the **Nellies Glen** and **Ruined Castle** areas located in the Blue Mountains National Park as part of the Australian Research Council Linkage project **History, heritage and environmental change in a deindustrialised landscape** led by Associate Professor Tanya Evans, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia, in partnership with the Blue Mountains World Heritage Institute, Lantern Heritage and Mountains Heritage. The project investigates a 19th-century shale-mining community in Jamison Valley through archaeological and archival research complemented by oral histories.
